I stayed at this wonderful resort for eight days. The reason why I deducted a star is because of the rather adventurous approach to the resort. You are required to traverse a long winding narrow kachha road. Barring that everything else is impeccable. The view from the resort is outstanding... especially in the night when the doon valley comes alive with the glittering lights of Dehradun. The resort is very spacious and well laid out....rooms are clean and well equipped with essentials.   Restaurant ambience is great and the staff even more pleasing. Food is simply superb. As I said the only negative is the approach to the resort but that is probably the price you gotta pay for relishing the wonderful experience once you are there.,Bala,/Profile/BaluKurg,40

"Sterling Mussoorie is the place to stay in Mussoorie. It‚Äôs not exactly on the Mall Road, but around 2.5 kms away from Mall Road, or the Mussoorie Library. To make you find the property easily let me guide you,One needs to turn left towards Tibetan Military Camp to and from there turn right and you would reach the hotel. The hotel is at the extreme corner of a hill top and on the Mussorrie mountain ranges, so the view from the hotel is simply mindblowing. The exterior of the hotel is very elegant and it‚Äôs a huge property with around 111 rooms. The staff of the property is kind humble and sweet and will make your stay wonderful.

"This was our first visit to a sterling property . Overall the resort is neat and clean and the staff are courteous and friendly . Staff members like Pyare, Ankita, Neha , Jaipal , Binod are very friendly and helpful .  However , the resort needs to make the following changes:-  1. The premier Mountain View room has a lovely balcony facing the doon valley, however the balcony has a raised wall which blocks the view . Pl replace it with glass facade  2. In a cold place like Mussoorie, the geysers are extremely small capacity , which means that for a family of 3 , it will take at least 90 minutes to shower , considering once you use the shower for 10 mins , it takes another 30 minutes to reheat . Please invest in better quality geysers or include boost options  3. Breakfast spread",Abc,/Profile/Foregat,30

It does not detach you from the town, the ever story telling Mussoorie lanes are within a walking distance.                             So what are you waiting for?

There are many rooms located on hill slope so one may have climb down a few floors to reach your room. But you get fantastic views of sunrise. The views are simply amazing. We could also see the lights of Dehradun city below. The resort is located a little away from the crowded Mall road and offers solitude. The approach to the resort is by a narrow hill road which can be scary at night time. But that is quite common at the hill stations.

"Sterling is a property to be in while in Mussorie. We visited in beginning July and experienced a pleasant weather with stunning views from resort and excellent service by the staff. Right from the comfortable rooms to breakfast, everything was above average. As we were with family, felt slight inconvenience for parents with too many staircase to get to the room. That is one thing to look out for when booking as the property has 111 rooms and it's quite spread out with. Thanking for a comfortable and amazing stay.",Sonam C,/Profile/sonamc851,50

The resort is well maintained with great rooms. We had mountain view rooms which were about 150-200 stairs away but the view they offered was unbeatable! Food is at par with the local market cafes rates and quantity is good considering the price. Tasted good. Breakfast has got a nice spread. Activity area and the entire resort is well maintained. Few things are chargeable and few aren't. Mobile network is zero almost everywhere in the resort except reception and dining area. WiFi is chargeable. Rates are high! Overall a good property. Worth it.,RajatDhingra,/Profile/RajatDhingra,50
"Pros: A good property, well maintained, decent food, nice scenic view. Cons: Location not good, away from mall road. Approach road not good. No free shuttle service to mall road, obviously coz of distance. Taxi service charges by hotel is 300 rupees for pick up and drop. Rooms are small for what they are charging. Major issue no mobile network. WI-FI is chargeable that is the worst part. Wi-fi should be free if network problem is there. A lot of indoor activities to do but again all are chargeable.  Hospitality is not upto the mark for the room charges. Food is bit expensive. No bar available. One might have to think to go again to mall road if they were back at resort.  Overall average experience.",utkarsh87,/Profile/utkarsh87,30

"Sterling Mussoorie like most of sterling‚Äôs properties is beautiful. It‚Äôs a big resort, which is located around 3kms away from the main town, which is great because the town area is extremely crowded.   Pros:  The resort in general and their rooms offer beautiful views. The rooms are very nice and comfortable, food is good and staff very friendly and helpful.   Cons:  The only issue I had is that they don‚Äôt have a travel desk and instead just put you in touch with local taxi union, who are over priced. In other sterling resorts that I have stayed like Ooty, they offer good travel facilities.  My only advice to the management would be to improve on this factor. Otherwise it‚Äôs a great resort, and my family and I throughly enjoyed our stay here. ",One city at a time,/Profile/traveling1atatime,40
