I stayed at this wonderful resort for eight days. The reason why I deducted a star is because of the rather adventurous approach to the resort. You are required to traverse a long winding narrow kachha road. Barring that everything else is impeccable. The view from the resort is outstanding... especially in the night when the doon valley comes alive with the glittering lights of Dehradun. The resort is very spacious and well laid out....rooms are clean and well equipped with essentials.   Restaurant ambience is great and the staff even more pleasing. Food is simply superb.

"Sterling Mussoorie is the place to stay in Mussoorie. It‚Äôs not exactly on the Mall Road, but around 2.5 kms away from Mall Road, or the Mussoorie Library. To make you find the property easily let me guide you,One needs to turn left towards Tibetan Military Camp to and from there turn right and you would reach the hotel. The hotel is at the extreme corner of a hill top and on the Mussorrie mountain ranges, so the view from the hotel is simply mindblowing. The exterior of the hotel is very elegant and it‚Äôs a huge property with around 111 rooms. The staff of the property is kind humble and sweet and will make your stay wonderful.

"This was our first visit to a sterling property . Overall the resort is neat and clean and the staff are courteous and friendly . Staff members like Pyare, Ankita, Neha , Jaipal , Binod are very friendly and helpful .  However , the resort needs to make the following changes:-  1. The premier Mountain View room has a lovely balcony facing the doon valley, however the balcony has a raised wall which blocks the view . Pl replace it with glass facade  2. In a cold place like Mussoorie, the geysers are extremely small capacity , which means that for a family of 3 , it will take at least 90 minutes to shower , considering once you use the shower for 10 mins , it takes another 30 minutes to reheat . Please invest in better quality geysers or include boost options  3. Breakfast spread",Abc,/Profile/Foregat,30

"has become our favourite resort in the sterling   Again we chose a room overlooking the plantation so that we would be woken up by real bird song, not an alarm bell. At first we were allotted a room overlooking the central walking area facing towards the pool, but since we had arrived early and there were rooms available looking towards the forest, Mr. Shiv who was our guide .",Debashish,/Profile/Debashishi,50

"Among all the sterlings that are there Mussoorie by far is the best one(or at least till now to me). The food is delicious(this has been Sterling‚Äôs one of the most weak points), the variety is pleasing. The cottage we got was spacious. The best part of this Sterling is however its proximity to the city. It does not detach you from the town, the ever story telling Mussoorie lanes are within a walking distance.                             So what are you waiting for? Go, relax, have great food, take a walk through the historic Mussoorie allies, come back keeping the distant Dehradun night view in company, seat back and relax again.",Amrita,/Profile/AmritaTheBhoot,50

"I believe this has to be rated one of the finest properties of Sterling Resorts. It has stunning views of the Doon Valley and Dehradun City in the night. The hospitality and warmth of the staff across the hotel is infectious and makes it very homely - be it the front desk, activity manager and the ever smiling restaurant staff !   Two negatives - walk to the rooms with good views is far & tiring. Geyser in the rooms are not of adequate capacity so water is extremely chilled most of the times !!",Sahil,/Profile/SKD03,40
