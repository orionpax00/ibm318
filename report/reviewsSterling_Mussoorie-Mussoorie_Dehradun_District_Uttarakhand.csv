I stayed at this wonderful resort for eight days. The reason why I deducted a star is because of the rather adventurous approach to the resort. You are required to traverse a long winding narrow kachha road. Barring that everything else is impeccable. The view from the resort is outstanding... especially in the night when the doon valley comes alive with the glittering lights of Dehradun. The resort is very spacious and well laid out....rooms are clean and well equipped with essentials.   Restaurant ambience is great and the staff even more pleasing. Food is simply superb. As I said the only negative is the approach to the resort but that is probably the price you gotta pay for relishing the wonderful experience once you are there.,Bala,/Profile/BaluKurg,40

"Sterling Mussoorie is the place to stay in Mussoorie. It‚Äôs not exactly on the Mall Road, but around 2.5 kms away from Mall Road, or the Mussoorie Library. To make you find the property easily let me guide you,One needs to turn left towards Tibetan Military Camp to and from there turn right and you would reach the hotel. The hotel is at the extreme corner of a hill top and on the Mussorrie mountain ranges, so the view from the hotel is simply mindblowing. The exterior of the hotel is very elegant and it‚Äôs a huge property with around 111 rooms. The staff of the property is kind humble and sweet and will make your stay wonderful.

"This was our first visit to a sterling property . Overall the resort is neat and clean and the staff are courteous and friendly . Staff members like Pyare, Ankita, Neha , Jaipal , Binod are very friendly and helpful .  However , the resort needs to make the following changes:-  1. The premier Mountain View room has a lovely balcony facing the doon valley, however the balcony has a raised wall which blocks the view . Pl replace it with glass facade  2. In a cold place like Mussoorie, the geysers are extremely small capacity , which means that for a family of 3 , it will take at least 90 minutes to shower , considering once you use the shower for 10 mins , it takes another 30 minutes to reheat . Please invest in better quality geysers or include boost options  3. Breakfast spread",Abc,/Profile/Foregat,30

It does not detach you from the town, the ever story telling Mussoorie lanes are within a walking distance.                             So what are you waiting for?

There are many rooms located on hill slope so one may have climb down a few floors to reach your room. But you get fantastic views of sunrise. The views are simply amazing. We could also see the lights of Dehradun city below. The resort is located a little away from the crowded Mall road and offers solitude. The approach to the resort is by a narrow hill road which can be scary at night time. But that is quite common at the hill stations.

Major issue no mobile network. WI-FI is chargeable that is the worst part. Wi-fi should be free if network problem is there. A lot of indoor activities to do but again all are chargeable.

"Sterling Mussoorie like most of sterling‚Äôs properties is beautiful. It‚Äôs a big resort, which is located around 3kms away from the main town, which is great because the town area is extremely crowded.   Pros:  The resort in general and their rooms offer beautiful views. The rooms are very nice and comfortable, food is good and staff very friendly and helpful.   Cons:  The only issue I had is that they don‚Äôt have a travel desk and instead just put you in touch with local taxi union, who are over priced. In other sterling resorts that I have stayed like Ooty, they offer good travel facilities.  My only advice to the management would be to improve on this factor.

The location is excellent and can see the scenic beauty of the city. The morning buffet is very nice as plenty choices of food were available. The room service menu is fine but can be bit longer.  All though this hotel doesnt have a concierge service but they arrange vehicles quickly from the taxi union. These taxi drivers are very honest and doesnt cheat to earn extra money.

Few Negative points are Mobile Network Signal, Paid Internet.

Later the hotel administration offered us the Buffet Dinner at little discounted price which we rejected being disappointed for goof up.

Then when we asked to show rooms as my parents were old and could not climb the crazy stairs at the property, he sent someone with us, then promptly called the guy and told him not to show any rooms and tell us all rooms are booked.

The height and the best view from the room is the best part of this hotel. Here are few pros and cons  Positives: 1. Location: Probably it is the highest hotel in area. That gives you beautiful view from your room itself. The room we stayed in was at their top floor and had a full glass window which gives breathtaking morning as well as night views of the Doon valley. But then comes negative part... you have to drive through very narrow road till the hotel which requires a very good driver. Mostly google map shows a longer route from the mall road but there is a shorter and better route to reach the hotel.  2. Rooms are spacious and clean. 3 Bathroom was clean 4.

"Sterling Mussoorie is one of the amazing resorts in the Mussoorie area. Very family friendly and esp kid friendly. We stayed there for a week in April 2019 and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.   Location: The resort is about 10 min drive away from Mall Road. While it may appear inconvenient because Mall Road is not right there, it is better because it is away from the unnecessary hustle bustle and also offers amazing views. Also the Mall Road is ‚Çπ300 by taxi one way so not so bad.   Food and entertainment: Food isn‚Äôt pricey at all and not too boring.

The property is massive and well made. However the rooms are ok with excellent views. There is no shower in the bathroom and one needs to use a bucket. At any time you will get only 1 bucket of hot water and you need wait for 30 mins for the next one. It's a hill top so there is no network for jio users and Vodafone network is on and  off. Wi-Fi is chargeable and not free. It's far away from the main city area and the only way to get there is through a taxi that charges 300 one way and is a rip off. Most hotels provide vehicles to mall road but not this one. Food is strictly ok. However the staff at the restaurant is lovely.  The travel desk while they say is none but call you and ask you to meet several times to enrol in their membership. We got a call at 05.30am for a travel,Traveller,/Profile/Monisha123,30

"Sterling Mussoorie a 4 star hotel. Finding the hotel was not difficult with google map. But reaching the hotel is quite tough as the road is very risky only one car can pass on that road and there is a valley on knr side. People who come for the first time were saying like a person can die before reaching the hotel. After check in a new mystery started finding the room it was like finding something in a maze. Its difficult to find a room. And ya reaching to the reception or restaurant from ur room, you will have to climb around 200 steps that also if u know the proper way to reach the lift. Otherwise u have to climb or come down again n again. Food was good but very costly. The staff at the reception is not worried about the guests.

Ordinary resort. Worst part is you will not get mobile network in this resort because of jammers placed by indian army. And even worst part is they only provide 1 hour of wifi service in your whole duration of stay. They are still in 19th century where hotels provide wifi for limited period. You will feel disconnected from the world. For every activity in activity room you have to pay price.   They don't have bar license.   Location is quite far from mall road and way to hotel is very dangerous. You can't reach to resort without getting your car scratched.

The rooms we had were good (twin- inter connecting rooms) having a fantastic view of valley.  Food is average.  The approach road to the hotel is quite narrow and somewhat adventurous.",Naresh,/Profile/JyothiNaresh,40

This resort doesn‚Äôt have a bar yet so you cannot plan to have a drink or two after a long weary day. The restaurant is not that comfortable too. However, the food was pretty good and kudos to the chef for that.

A bit of a walk away from the Mall Road where all the eating places and crowd is - but one goes to a hill station to get away from that right.  The food is good, and the restaurant staff very helpful in getting together a meal with local cuisine.  The breakfast is a bit of a seating nightmare though- too few tables and all the guests come in at 9:30 am. Go early to beat the rush and you are fine.

"The Good  1. Rooms - Decor is very elegant. Rooms are super spacious with full view of the valley. Privilege Suite has separate seating area and equipped with all the facilities.  2. Ambience - Reception is good with seating areas. Restaurant is in excellent location with panoramic view of the valley. Rooms have good vibrant colors and decor.  3. Ample car parking and Kids friendly.  4. Food - BF buffet spread is decent. cakes and other baked items are an exception and below average.  What can be improved: 1. Service -   a. When you arrive by your vehicle, the entry gate is at a steep angle and hence you expect the security guard to be on his toes looking for guests or atleast listen to the honk. You will have to wait for the personnel to lazily come and open the gate after a",upratap,/Profile/upratap,50

"First impression - warm welcome, quick check-in, amazing views from the rooms. The hotel is located a little away from the main city area. So you will need a taxi everytime you want to venture out. So if you plan to stay away during the day then it is ok but if you plan to go to and fro from the hotel to the city centre then its better you dont stay here. Our first impression turned sour as the day went.  Firstly, there is absolutely no network inside the hotel. Second, the hotel does not provide free wifi which is so surprising because nowadays any low grade hotel also gives free wifi. One hour of free wifi for one device per stay is only provided!!!! Does it even make sense?!!!!! Now coming to the next day morning......it was pretty cold in Mussourie. And the least you can",Avani S,/Profile/186avanis,20

Here there is a lovely old fashioned coffee shop called Landour Bake House.  They serve you some delicious pastries and other baked items. And must not try their coffee too.

"The place is located 2 kms away from the mall road and the road is narrow and difficult to drive for newbie. The view from the room is great and the food is excellent. But we had done online booking and were allotted the rooms for which you had take minimum 100 steps down and 100 steps whenever we wanted to come to the lobby. So basically whenever we had breakfast, dinner or wanted to leave the hotel, we had to climb 100 stairs so we were mostly out of breath every time we reached the lobby. So if you are fit then it should be easy for you. Would not recommend it for people with senior citizens or with people having back/ leg/ breathing problems. ",Ratika G,/Profile/Ratz_z_z,30

"Stayed at Sterling Mussoorie Resort this weekend with my family. It was a good experience, mornings and evenings had clear sky for enjoying nice view of entire Doon valley. Resort provides excellent view from all rooms and mind it that it hasb120 rooms/cottages. Sterling made our stay comfortable which is a tough task in hills and more so in the Monsoon rains. Food and house keeping were in line with Sterling reputation.Family enjoyed short stay to the fullest. ",jaspalkohli05,/Profile/jaspalkohli05,50

"Stayed in Classic Room from 21st to 24th Aug, 2018. Location is a bit far from the Mall Road. Do not rely on Google Maps for navigating to the hotel, it shows a longer and tougher route. If you are looking for a peaceful and secluded vacation, this is the place for you. There is no phone signal in the rooms. You have to come to the lobby or mostly outside to make a phone call. If only there was complementary wifi, the things could've been better. The breakfast spread is elaborate as expected from a good hotel like this. Activities are enough to keep you occupied. The massages at the spa will leave you refreshed. Overall it was a good stay, could've been better. ",Varun B,/Profile/vbhambri,30

We saw a distinct change taking place as the property became Thomas Cook ... Today, we go almost every six months with some friend or the other, and we have many friends who swear by this property in particular ... Tucked away over three kilometers off the Gandhi Chowk, away from the Mall Road, the resort provide some awesome and picturesque views of the Dehradoon Valley below and Mussoorie across ...

For the explorers, they provide a city tour and take you for trekking, waterfall, corn village etc. They have something for everyone.   If you are travelling in big groups, I suggest you should also request for garhwali thali to be arranged under the stars. Else, you can always relish the delicacies in the restaurant.

"Generally I don't expect much when staying at sterling as most of their resorts are a bit dated now, but at Mussoorie the sterling resort looks really good. The views from this place is spectacular, rooms are pretty big and clean. Even the service was good here which was a big surprise. The only down side of the whole experience is the walking distance to the room, this property is huge and if you get a room that's far from the reception then be ready for a daily hike.

No one showed us around the premises or even told us what facilities they have .  They had given us a complimemtary upgrade to suite room. But that was a trick I guess . As the suite room had absolutely no view. We could not see a single moutain . All we could see was the ugly green roof of the rooms below us .  I went to the reception and they showed me a room with a decent view . But I was told that 2 rooms were not available side by side . They were on 2 seperate floors .

"I am a very old Sterling member but I think the last visit to any property was maybe 12 years back. I was planning to sell my membership but after this visit I have dropped my plans. A very nice resort, very well maintained, very good food and very courteous staff, I was pleasantly surprised. I had a one room apartment which was large size with a good balcony. Bathroom was also nice. Bed was comfy.  Location is fantastic on top of a hill far from the tourist area with beautiful views all around. Vehicle is readily available to & fro Mall Road in Mussoorie and not very expensive. However I didnt find Mussoorie worth a visit, nothing to do, but Sterling property is very nice. It seems they are back on track.",Raj S,/Profile/r_sarda,50

All the indoor activities except Table tennis are paid, even playing Dart is also paid. Outdoor activities arranged by hotel are also paid but it's worth the money they take. The approach to this property is too bad and one can't take risk getting his own vehicle here. Mall road is about 2 kms away but the way is too dangerous and very narrow.

To start with couple of things that I would like to talk about this place. The hotel is standing on a hill approx. 3 kms + from the main Mall Road. The property is huge and spread over the hill. If you are going with kids and some elderly people would suggest taking the rooms which are not downhill, as one will have to walk up all the way up, however the lifts are there.

If you want to spend few nights away from home and away from traffic jams and maddening crowd in the city of mussoorie this is the place to be. About 2.5 km from mall road and library chowk it offers splendid view of doon valley. It is recently renovated and offers good value for money food. Try Ala Carte rather than buffet. Food is tasty and sumptuous. Only disadvantage approach road is too narrow.,Pallavgupta,/Profile/Pallavgupta,40

There are a few parts of our experience that stood out and I'd like to highlight them here: - We were first given a room that had a great view with one entire wall of glass panels but there was no window that we could open. Since we'd travelled all the way from Delhi just so we could enjoy the weather in Mussoorie, it we were extremely disappointed about having to be cooped up inside a room with no ventilation. There was an air conditioner in the room but we felt that defeated the whole purpose of staying in the hills. Also, there aren't really any common areas that are open where you can sit and have a cup of tea or a meal while enjoying the weather. We had booked this property",Meera S,/Profile/meerasapra,40

However, the rooms in the entire resort is spread over and the approach to the reception and dining area may be a bit tiring, especially for old people.

"I have seen this property from late 90s. It was great then and since it is now little old, some of its charm had lost. But this year I saw they have newly renovated the central building, restaurants and put in much needed lifts (although some one more is needed). The views remain spectacular, you can see Dehradoon day time and lights in the night time. It's very peaceful as a property. Slightly aloof from main city (could be both good or bad, depending on what you need). The road leading to the resort is narrow and hasn't improved at all (although it's a shared road and you can't blame the hotel).   The staff hasn't changed much, still have room for improvement in their professionalism.

Firstly i would like to say that do not go as per the hotels website. What you see online versus the product you get in reality are opposite polls. There is no WI FI except the lobby and absolutely no mobile network where the rooms are situated. Food is average and hardly has any  variety. However with this level of poor product the team members really try to ensure that your stay is comfortable. For this price bracket you have better hotels and much nearer to Mall Road.,Shuvro S,/Profile/shuvrosanyal,20

Amazing property with splendid views. Went with my wife and son. We were offered an appartment room. View of the valley was just amazing. Breakfast and dinner spread is good and elaborate.  Some points to be noted; The hotel is spead deep down to 7 to 8 floors so in case somebody is travelling with kids staying in rooms at higher floors make sense. At times you need to climb a lot.  The hotel is located slightly off the main market on a cliff. Approach road is extremely narrow hence travelling at night or dinner outside is not advisable due to location.  Restaurant staff is very less leading to service issues during breakfast and dinner   We booked it through sterling website and dinner was prepaid.

We visited with Family and Kids in this resort for 2 nights stay and booked 3 rooms. I should say this was our wrong decision to select this resort.. The road which leads to the property was one very narrow where only one car can pass and if any vehicle comes from the other way then u are blocked!! The property is located about 2.5kms away from the main market; Resort does not even provide any transport facility to at least drop till the market. The worst part is you will have to book the cab that too you will be given only small hatchback or sedan cars... As we were family of 6 adults and 2 kids so we always had to take 2 cabs.

One of my first visits to a Sterling resort was quite impressive! The location is away from the Mall Road and must say the road is quite narrow.Constant rains had worsened the road conditions. The resort itself is built on many levels and could be a demerit for people located in rooms away from the reception. The resort reception and dining area are beautifully done. The glimpse of Doon valley at night from the dining area is highly recommended. I personally felt the rooms to be a bit overcrowded and the rest of the resort view not to be very appealing. The staff was very hospitable and the food was decent. As such the rooms are clean and the stay is comfortable and I did enjoy my stay despite the persistent rains!!,Nitwit2015,/Profile/Nitwit2015,40

The house keeping service was above average, linens were OK. Room Service was OK and food taste was also OK. Because of the way property is located, one will have to necessarily take a number of steps to reach the main lobby and restaurant area. It is understandable but old people will find it difficult to walk up and down dozens of steps. From where we stayed we had to take 100 steps up and use two elevators to reach the Lobby and Restaurant. Room Service was not clearing the plates after a service even after several reminders.

Also the hotel does not have enough lifts, so some of our team members really found it difficult to use the stairs!

To begin with; the property is agood 3 kms away from the main mall road stretch. Which makes it a bit challenging to commute frequently if needed. The views of the doon valley do make up for the good aspects of the property though.   Not all rooms benefit from the valley view and hence if you end up in a non valley view room; it would be a poor experience. The rooms are average. Some experience leakage issues still in the lower wings.   The property is spread out over multiple levels and hence it is quite a climb over atleast 50 steps if you are in the lower levels   The breakfast and food servings are strictly average. Could certainly get better in variety and flavour.   If you are looking for seclusion and a tranquil setting; this is the place to be then.,Yogesh D,/Profile/yogeshd860,30

But, this time around, I was happy to see a new face of the reception, dining, gaming and activity area with the installation of lifts.

The staff is very energetic working towards your comforts yet allowing you with privacy. There are some activities within hotel for young and those who are young at heart.

At 4500m height we finally touched the destination and wasted or extra 1 hour in searching our holiday resort as the regular road was being repaired and another route was taken to reach.

And surprisingly they gave us the newly renovated cottage which was absolutely gorgeous. Our cottage had two rooms with a small lobby and a kitchen in the middle of the two rooms. A balcony with a refreshing view. I have been going to sterling, mussorie with family from the age of 7 or 8. I have so many memories attached to the place. We had a wonderful stay as usual. The mall road is about 10-15 minutes away.

So, if you are ready to do this up-down daily, take those rooms.  You won't get signals in your room and the hotel will not permit use of wifi even in the lobby. Everything is charged.

"Trust me when i say this, after booking with this hotel there are bound to be some things happening. Main reason for this to happen is the lack of information provided by their website. Also, if you would look up the place on Google maps then you'll reach some other location. Such as,  a) you'll become an even more expert driver or  b) you'll damage your car at multiple places.  The reason for the above being the stupid approach to the hotel. There is barely any place for one car to drive. And if by any chance another car comes from the opposite direction then you're in for a ride.  I stayed in room 327 and the number of ""STAIRS"" i had to take to reach the room were 237.

This has been the worst experience with Sterling property. Booked two weeks ago and yet at the time of check in we had to wait for two hours to get the rooms.

Rooms are a bit dowdy and under-whelming.   The restaurant is pricier than similar food items in town, but they have you over a barrel, so its your only dining option. Dining room staff are a little clueless and  meal timings are random, better suited to an Indian schedule of very late dinner, not really a western time-table.

They were adjacent to where a massive renovation was underway and the staff wasn't available when needed. To make it all worse, there were HUGE parking issues and when we tried to call the manager on duty (Mr Rajendra Mathure) to assist resolve since the guards on duty were not helpful, he was not only rude but he said stuff like --- I have a life, do you want me to have",Avika N,/Profile/AvikaNagpal,10
"We hesitantly booked Sterling (being members) for our stay recently. We were provided newly renovated guest rooms, which are quite nice. the view from the resort is good, located at an elevation. Food was ok, though you don't have much choice at that location. Its worthwhile only for members. Biggest disappointment was that rooms have no view/balcony, as they were located at the basement overlooking hotel staff quarters.",Sandyag321,/Profile/Sandyag321,30
"This hotel staff does not know single thing about the service industry and top of all the hotel staff is not educated at all.

The dairy foods are particularly good because the cattle in these areas are well-bred.

"The good:  1. Excellent views of the valley from the room (may depend on the room you choose).  2. Far from the crowd, and hence lots of privacy. This means it's good for couples seeking privacy.  3. Quiet, and pleasat through the day and night.  4. The resort is full of beautiful and fragrant flowers - especially wild roses.  5. The hotel is located in the part of the valley is not heavily crowded, and as a result, one gets views of mountains that are largely uninhabited. This is a huge plus.  The bad:  1. The resort is situated about 2.5 kilo meters away from the main market, but the resort does not provide any kind of transportation for free.
