haridwar,"Stayed for 2 nights with family. Itâ€™s an excellent place to get the feel of Ganga. The hotel has a small ghat to take a dip in Ganga as well. Food was homely and reasonably good. Improvements can be the housekeeping services like better quality linen, towels and regular up-keep of the coffee bags. Tariffs are high compared to the room size. Still I would recommend it primarily because of the amazing view the rooms have.",Randeep,/Profile/Randeepbora,"New Delhi, India",40
haridwar,"Loved our stay, amazing location right by the bank of the Ganges (with the facility of a private Ghat), good food in the rooftop restaurant amidst scanty sunlight, and great service by a courteous staff. Hoping to visit again in this new year. A must-stay spot for all",Shayari Banerjee,/Profile/shayarib3499,,50

Nice Hotel with all modern facilities, great location, Ganga Facing Rooms are just out of the world, great staffs, nice food. 10-12 minutes Walkable distance to Harki Pauri. Highly Recommended if you are planning to visit Haridwar.",Pinaki B,/Profile/PinakiBhattacharya,"New Delhi, India",50
haridwar,"If you are visiting Haridwar and not staying near any Ghat, it does not make any sense. Ganga Sadan is nice place to stay with family, as it is adjacent to Ramgaht it gives very nice feeling. Though approach to the hotel is from bit narrow lane but dont get dejected by that, hotel is good, clean and good staff. Food quality is also very good safe for even child. roof top restaurant and the view thereof is awesome. But keep in mind you are in Haridwar hence, even three star hotels are bit like two star only. The key thing is proximity to ghat and market. Enjoy Haridwar.",Hiten Sheth,/Profile/hmsheth,,40
haridwar,Visited this property with family . The rooms are very well kept with all the amenities and the overall property is very nicely done up quite cozy but most importantly the staff are very cooperative and responsive and that's is the biggest USP of the hotel  The only negative thing about the hotel is the size of the rooms specially the washrooms which are very small.,hemantparmanandka,/Profile/hemantparmanandka,,40
haridwar,"I stayed there in sep 19, Hotel is very clean and hygienic. Rooms are also very neat & clean. Reception staff is very helpful (Mr. Mukesh specially)I really appreciate. Further, the serving staff also very good.   But food items little expensive as charging for a cup of tea Rs. 75 appears to be at very higher side since 1 litre milk cost only Rs55 aprx. In my think price should be reasonable.",nks,/Profile/nk85,,30

haridwar,"I stayed at Ganga Sadan in September and it was an amazing place for staying. From cleanliness to amazing staff, the stay made us feel at home. The also have a personal Ghat and an amazing rooftop breakfast and dinner. The river flows just behind the hotel and you see it from your rooms. It was indeed a peaceful stay.",Deepali S,/Profile/DeepaliS197,,50
haridwar,We visited Haridwar to take a holy dip in Ganga river in the last week of July. Due to Kavdi festival the roads to the hotel was blocked. The hotel sent their staff Arjun who guided us through an alternate route to reach hotel. I was impressed with their customer service. The hotel is impressive and more importantly they have a private ganga ghat with change room. We had our holy Ganga dip in this private ghat. The service in this hotel is excellent. Food very tasty. They have restaurant that opens up to a large balcony from where one gets an excellent view of river Ganga and haridwar. I strongly recommend this hotel.,Ramanujam Thodur,/Profile/Ramanujam_Thodur,,50
